# SalahTime

## App Setup Instructions 
  -  Project created using Angular CLI v20.3.4
  -  Start local server: `ng serve`
  -  Open app at: http://localhost:4200/ Auto reloads on source file changes
  -  Generate a new component: `ng generate component component-name`
  -  View all schematics: `ng generate --help`
  -  Build the project: `ng build`

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

# Mobile APK Build Instructions

Follow these steps to generate a signed APK for your Angular + Capacitor project.
1. Build Angular App Run the following command to build your Angular project:    ` npm run build`
2. Copy Web Assets to Capacitor Copy the web assets to Capacitor:    `npx cap copy`
install capasitor packs `npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli --save`
install android pack `npm install @capacitor/android`

3. Add Android Platform (Only Once) Add the Android platform to your project:      `npx cap add android` (Skip this step if Android platform is already added to avoid overwriting changes.)
4. Copy Again After Adding Platform Copy assets specifically for Android: `npx cap copy android`
5. Open Android Project in Android Studio Open the Android project:`npx cap open android`
6. (Optional) Build Unsigned Release APK via Command Line Navigate to the Android folder:    `cd android`
7. Run Gradle to assemble the release APK: `gradlew clean` then`gradlew assembleRelease`
8. This generates `app-release-unsigned.apk` at: `cd D:\salah-time-board\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release`
9. Sign the APK Sign the unsigned APK using `apksigner`: `apksigner sign --ks "D:\salah-time-board\android\app\my-release-key.keystore" --out salahtime.apk app-release-unsigned.apk`
10. Notes: - Ensure `apksigner` is in your system PATH (comes with Android SDK build-tools). - Verify the unsigned APK path if you get a "no such file" error. Verify the Signed APK (Recommended) Verify the APK signature:   `apksigner verify app-release-signed.apk`

---



## Common Gotchas
- In `android/app/build.gradle`, ensure `minifyEnabled false` under release config if you don't want code shrinking.
- Keystore path and alias must match the ones used during signing.
- Always build from a clean state if assets are changed:

    npx cap clean
    npm run build
    npx cap copy android



Genere abb 
cd android   
`gradlew clean`
`gradlew bundleRelease`

issue : app-release.aab All uploaded bundles must be signed.
<!-- cd D:\salah-time-board\android\app\build\outputs\bundle\release -->
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000


Remove conflicts from the manifest before uploading. The following content provider authorities are in use by other developers: com.salahtime.fileprovider.You need to use a different package name because "com.salahtime" already exists in Google Play.




3. Build Release APK or AAB

cd android
Run one of the following (inside android folder):

➡ For APK: `./gradlew assembleRelease`
➡ For AAB (recommended for Play Store):`./gradlew bundleRelease`



Icon Prompt

Generate an icon for my Salah Time app.
The background should be dark green.
Include a mosque frame, and inside it, place a clock dial.
Add small text “SalahTime” below the clock, within the mosque frame.
The overall design should be clean, minimalistic, and well-balanced.
